[**Tangeritin**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangeritin) is a flavone that is found in tangerine and other citrus peels. Tangeritin strengthens the cell wall and acts as a plant's defensive mechanism against disease-causing pathogens. Tangeritin shows enormous potential as an anticancer agent: *in vitro* studies show antimutagenic antiinvasive and antiproliferative effects.
